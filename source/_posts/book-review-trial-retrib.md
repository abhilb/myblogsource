[This](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2227795.Trial_and_Retribution) is my third [Lynda La Plante](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7929.Lynda_La_Plante) novel and first in the series of six novels. The television adaptation of the same came on ITV. After reading two of her other novels (Anna Travis series), I had high hopes for this one and it didn't dissapoint me. It appears though that it was written with television adaptation in mind. I am not sure if this book is a re-write of the TV series script. Either way there is a lot of court room drama which I haven't come across in other crime thrillers that I have read in the past. 

The story is about a little girl who was playing alone in the playground opposite to an estate building disappears and is later found dead. The suspicion goes back and forth between the step dad, Peter and a drunk neighbor Michael Dunn. Dunn is an alcoholic with a troubled past and was himself a victim of child abuse. After a lot of drama and twists in the plot the real culprit if found.

I really liked the strong female characters in the novel. The suspense and the twists in the plot are really good. Hope to get hold of the next book in this series soon.
