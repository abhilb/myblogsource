The story is set in the World War II era and is narrated in first person. The protagonist of the story, Henry Chinaski is an alcoholic who moves from one city to another, from one job to another, picking up brawls and having sex with whores. Everytime he lands a job, he gets bored turns up drunk or with a hangover and eventually gets fired. He then moves on to a different city and a different job and the cycle continues.

At the start of each chapter, I wonder, will he make it? Will he be able to get out of the pathetic life? With just over 200 pages, it is a quick read. The narration is very direct, with no beating around the bush and racy at times. 

What I liked the most about the protagonist, is that he knows what his problems are and what he probably needs to do. But he simply doesn't care. The following quote from the book sums up the character,

"My ambition is handicapped by laziness".

Surely, there are a lot Chinaski's in the real world, more so during the World War II era. With unemployment, war and social inequality, one will lose hope and seek shelter in inebriation. Or may be the fault lies in the upbringing. Whatever the reason be, it is sad thing to witness. And the author has captured this very nicely. 

I would definitely recommend everyone to read it. My rating - 4/5.
