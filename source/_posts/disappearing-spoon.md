[The Disappearing Spoon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7247854-the-disappearing-spoon) by Sam Kean gives an excellent tour of the Periodic Table. Instead of picturing the periodic table as an overwhelming set of rows and columns of elements, one could see the underlying pattern. It doesn't too deep into the theory and isn't too shallow either. It is written in a well balanced way that any one with a little science background could easily understand the concepts.. 

What makes it more interesting are the little anecdotes and historical facts associated with each element. Things one wouldn't find in any text books but helps one to put everything in context. My favourite anecdote is about William Shockley and the invention of transistor. Most of the electronics text books has the picture of the first transistor model and the group photo of the trio who invented the transistor (John Bardeen, William Shockley and Walter Brattain at Bell Labs, 1948.) ![Their photo. Source Wikipedia](/contents/img/Bardeen_Shockley_Brattain_1948.JPG) Apparently it was Bardeeen and Brattain who must be given credit for the invention. At the time of the invention William Shockley was holidaying in Europe. He gets back just in time not only to take the credit but he stopped Bardeen and Brattain to work further on the transistor. 

The book is full of such little anectdotes which makes it really fun to read. Some of the other anecdotes that I found really interesting are that of Louis Pasteur and Madam Curie.
